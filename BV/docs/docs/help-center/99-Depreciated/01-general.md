## Description

The help center is intended to be a source of assistance for merchants, especially smaller 'Mom & Pop' type merchants who may not be very familiar with payments processing technology. Most of the help center is a different site on a different platform, hosted by a CMS such as SiteCore.

Like the rest of the site, the content in the help center is localized and available in five languages:
- English
- Queen's English
- French Canadian
- Traditional Chinese
- Simplified Chinese

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can navigate to the help center to seek assistance.
2. Help Center content is translated to the language specified in their settings.

## Assumptions
- SiteCore will be the CMS.
- Global Payments will provide translated content.
