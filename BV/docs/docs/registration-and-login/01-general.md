## Summary <a name="summary"></a>

BusinessView is only available to active customers of Global Payments. These customers need to have the ability to authenticate their identity to access the BusinessView application as well as register a new, valid merchant account. The Registration and Login features outline the requirements that define the process and functionality for both current and new users to gain access to the BusinessView application.

### Who:
- Only current customers are allowed to register or login to BusinessView. These customers must first have a current account with Global Payments before a BusinessView account can be created.

### What:
- The login process allows existing customers to access their account information without direct support from Global Payments.
- The registration process allows existing customers to use their existing MID to register for the BusinessView product.

### Why:
- To self support their business needs, customers need the ability to access and utilize the features offered by BusinessView to review and maintain their financial transaction activities.

## Non-MVP Future Needs

1. Need to research how to get BusinessView to translate text form the very first page prior to login to assist users through the registration process. Current design is to default to English until the language selection screen.
