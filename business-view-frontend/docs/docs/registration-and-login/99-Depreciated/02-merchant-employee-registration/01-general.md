## Description

Merchant Employees have the ability to register for an account after a Merchant Owner adds them as a new user. ISO Employees also have the ability to register for an account after an ISO Admin adds them as a new user. These employees should receive an email inviting them to create a Business View username, password, etc. without requiring an MID. The employees should then be able to sign in to Business View with their username and password, and access the data in the hierarchies their admin has constrained them to.
